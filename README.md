### 🏠 [index.html](index.html)

An example HTML homepage demonstrating:
- Semantic HTML structure (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`)
- Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`)

## Getting Started

1. **Read the onboarding document**: Start with [`onboarding.md`](onboarding.md) and follow the roadmaps sequentially.

2. **Complete the tasks**: Look for **▶ Try This** sections throughout the document and actually do them.

3. **Validate your work**: Use the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check your code.

4. **Reference the example**: Check out [`index.html`](index.html) to see a complete, validated example homepage.

## Learning Approach

- **Self-paced**: Work through materials at your own pace during evenings/weekends
- **Hands-on**: Understanding comes from doing, not just reading
- **Validated**: All HTML examples are validated and follow web standards
- **Practical**: Concepts connect directly to real-world app development
